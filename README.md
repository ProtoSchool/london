# [ARCHIVED] ProtoSchool London

*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).

üëã Hello decentralisers of London ‚ú®üé∑üê©

Want to know more about the peer-to-peer web? Let meet up! We're going to figure out how to upgrade the internet together. Anyone who wants to talk about decentralising the web, learn, and share ideas is welcome.

We may be decentralised, but we can assemble!

Help us plan the first event: https://github.com/ProtoSchool/london/issues/1
